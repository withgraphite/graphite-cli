# Graphite CLI Changelog

## 0.19.4 2022-07-05

- Based on a user survey, we've slightly changed the defaults for PR title and description on `submit` commands.
  - PR Title defaults to the title of the first (or only) commit on the branch.
  - PR Description defaults to a list of commit messages followed by a PR template, if one exists.
- `branch info` and `log` now show the commit hash of trunk.
- Added a `repo init --reset` which clears all Graphite metadata.
- Added a new user-scoped configuration enabled by `gt user restack-date --use-author-date` which when enabled passes `--committer-date-is-author-date` to the internal `git rebase` of restack operations. To return to the default, use `gt user restack-date --no-use-author-date`.
- Added autocompletion for the `branch up` disambiguation prompt.
- Added `gt dpr` as a shortcut for `gt dash pr`
- Renamed the `--no-draft` option for `submit` commands to `--publish/-p`. There are three modes of operation for the command:
  - By default, leave existing PRs in the same state and create new PRs in draft mode.
  - When `--draft/-d` is passed, all PRs in the submit scope will be marked as draft.
  - When `--publish/-p` is passed, all PRs in the submit scope will be marked ready for review.
- Added an interactive prompt for `gt branch rename` when no new name is passed in.
- Added a `--force/-f` option for `gt branch track` that skips the interactive prompt by picking the nearest tracked ancestor.

- Fixed a bug where `branch submit` and `downstack submit` base validation would fail incorrectly on certain operating systems.
- Fixed a bug where leftover cached metadata across CLI versions could result in inconsistent state.

## 0.19.3 2022-06-28

- Changed the flow of `gt branch track`. Now, it tracks the current branch by default, unless another branch is specified. By default, prompts the user to select a branch to be its parent if there are multiple possibilities, or you can pass in a `--parent`.
- Updated the new `log short` view to be more comprehensible (uses diagram symbols from `log`).

- Fixed a bug where `--restack` wouldn't restack all branches as expected if `gt repo sync` was run from trunk.
- Fixed a bug where `gt ss` would fail if run from trunk.
- Fixed a bug where `gt downstack get` would fail to get branches that existed locally but were untracked by `gt`.
- Fixed a bug where after a `git rebase`, Graphite metadata could end up in a broken state.
- Fixed a bug that prevented `gt feedback --with-debug-context` from working as expected.
- Fixed a bug where `gt upstack onto` interactive selection could appear wonky.

- Fixed some copy in v0.19 newly added features.

## 0.19.2 2022-06-15

- Fixed an issue where `downstack get` was completely broken.
- Replaced the emoji for `Pushing to remote and creating/updating PRs...` step of `submit`
- Fixed an issue where `gt branch edit` would only work if the branch was not in need of restacking.
- Added support to rebase local changes on top of remote for `downstack get`
- Fixed a bug where choosing to cancel `submit` because of an empty branch did not abort correctly.

## 0.19.1 2022-06-14

- Removed some development tooling as a workaround to unblock Homebrew release. Sorry for the delay!
- Fixed a shebang issue that resulted from trying to clean up Node.js v18 warnings. Added a different fix to prevent Node.js warnings from showing up in CLI output.
- Fixed a bug with Node.js v14 support.
- Changed the Homebrew Node.js dependency to v16, which is the same as we use for development.

## 0.19.0 2022-06-13

- Ensured every commonly used command has an alias and changed a few names. A current list of commands will be included in the Community Slack with this release.

  - `gt branch show` is now `gt branch info`. As this command is relatively new, we are not leaving `show` as an alias.
  - `gt branch create --restack` is now `gt branch create --insert`. This was the originally intended name, and it does something different than `gt repo sync --restack`
  - `gt downstack sync` is now `gt downstack get`. It was confusing to have two `sync` commands do entirely different things!
  - The old names `gt branch prev` and `gt branch next` for `down` and `up` are now fully deprecated.

- Updated a significant portion of the info and error messages spanning almost every command.
- Ensured every command has up-to-date and helpful `--help`.
- Added a number of tips to various commands.
- Greatly improved autcompletion — now every command has autocomplete for nouns, verbs, flags, and branch names when applicable.
- `gt branch checkout`, `gt upstack onto`, and `gt branch track` now all have substring autocompletion for interactive branch selection. Enjoy! :D
- `gt auth` and `gt user` commands can now be run outside of a Git repository.

- Removed the concept of "ignored branches" from `gt repo init`, and the user config.Removed the `gt repo ignored-branches` command.
- Removed `gt <scope> fix`. `fix` is now an alias for `restack`.
- Removed `gt <scope> validate`
- Removed `gt branch parent`, `gt branch children`, and `gt branch pr-info`. All of this information is now found in `gt branch info`. `gt branch rename` is now the only way to reset PR info for a branch, as PR info is now synced by branch name for the open PR with that name.
- Removed `gt repo fix`.
- Removed `gt repo trunk`. You can change the trunk branch by running `gt repo init --trunk <trunkName>` .
- Removed `exec` functionality of `gt downstack edit` — we recommend using `gt stack test` for running a command on each branch in your stack.

- Added a new command `gt branch track`. In order to track an existing git branch `<branchName>`, ensure that it is based on a Graphite branch `<parentBranchName>`, and then with `<parentBranchName>` checked out, run `gt branch track <branchName>` to start tracking it as a Graphite branch.
  - You can also specify a `--parent` in `gt branch track` instead of checking out the desired parent before running the command.
  - If run without a branch to track `gt branch track` suggests branches that have the current branch/specified parent in their history.
- Added `gt branch untrack` to remove Graphite metadata for a branch.
- Added a new flow to `gt repo init` for letting users new to Graphite convert an existing "stack" of branches into a Graphite stack. Essentially calls `gt branch track` in a loop.

- Added a new verb `gt <scope> restack` for the `branch`, `upstack`, `downstack`, and `stack` nouns. For each branch in the scope, this command checks if the branch is based on its parent, and rebases it if necessary. `gt upstack fix` and `gt stack fix` will alias to `restack` for a couple versions.

- Improved `gt log short` - the view now essentially a single-line-per-branch version of `gt log`. The old style can still be accessed with `gt log short --classic`.
- Added a `--reverse` option to `gt log` and `gt log short`. Helpful for big stacks!
- Added `--stack` option for `gt log` and `gt log short`. Only displays the current stack (i.e. what `gt stack submit` would submit).
- Added `--steps <n>` option for `gt log` and `gt log short`. Implies `--stack` and only shows `n` levels above and below the current branch.
- Rebase conflict message now shows a `gt log short --steps 3` centered at the branch being resolved.
- Interactive selection for `gt branch checkout` and `gt upstack onto` now uses the new `gt log short` view. Much easier to see what you're doing with long branch names!

- `gt dash` can now open the PR page for the current branch or a specified one: `gt dash pr [numberOrBranchName]`
- `gt branch info` can now show the current PR description with `--description`.
- Added `upstack` and `downstack` counterparts of `gt branch test`.

- `gt branch delete` now restacks the deleted branch's children onto its parent.

- Removed the `--resubmit` flow from `repo sync` — we may add it back in the future.
- Added a `--restack` option to `repo sync`, which restacks the current branch and any branches in stacks with cleaned up branches. We imagine a common flow if you know that you don't have conflicts with trunk will be `gt rs -rf`. Or even `gt rs -rf && gt ss`.

- Fixed a bug where `--draft` and `--no-draft` on `submit` commands would unnecessarily submit unchanged PRs.
- Fixed bugs related to rebases not being performed properly that often resulted in confusing state and messaging.

- Now fails gracefully if running on an unsupported Node.js version (requires Node.js version 14 or higher)
- The Graphite CLI experience survey is no longer shown when commands are run in non-interactive mode.

**Note from the maintainers:**

Thanks for trying out the new version of the Graphite CLI! Please let us know if you see any issues with this new version, or have any suggestions for improvements related to functionality, flow, or transparency/simplicity.

New documentation for the CLI is coming soon! We love hearing your feedback about what documentation would be helpful — keep it coming!

Rebasing on `gt downstack get` has been outscoped for this release in order to get it to you sooner! We're still excited to put it out soon.

## 0.18.7 2022-05-31

- Fixed a pervasive bug that prevented using `gt` on Windows at all — there are likely still remaining issues to work out before we have full support, and we still recommend using WSL for the most stable Graphite experience. Thanks to our community for helping out here!
- Fixed a bug where `git push` error messages would not be displayed on `submit`, resulting in confusion around whether pushes were failing because of e.g. `pre-push` hooks or`--force-with-lease` errors.
- Added better support for multiple checkouts (i.e. `git worktree`). We consider our support experimental, see the new section of the docs for details.

## 0.18.6 2022-05-20

- Fixed a bug where running `gt branch rename` on submitted branches would result in `gt` becoming largely unusable.
- Added a new `--force/-f` option to `gt branch rename` that is required for already-submitted branches.
- `gt branch rename` now respects character replacement settings.

## 0.18.5 2022-05-19

- `.` and `/` are no longer replaced in branch names.
- Fixed a regression where the current branch wouldn't be selected by default in `gt branch checkout` interactive mode.
- Upgraded `node` and `yarn` dependencies, please let us know if you see any weirdness!

## 0.18.4 2022-05-16

- `gt downstack sync` no longer requires turning on a configuration option to use (for real this time)

## 0.18.3 2022-05-13

- Rewrote `gt downstack sync` using a different mechanism for fetching remote stack dependencies.
- `gt downstack sync` no longer requires turning on a configuration option to use.
- Fixed an issue in `submit` where in-progress PR title wouldn't be saved if the user cancelled while writing the body.

## 0.18.2 2022-05-12

- Fixed certain cases of an issue where restacking after `stack edit` and `commit create` would use an incorrect upstream. A broader fix is coming in v0.19.0.
- Fixed an issue where after certain `downstack edit` or `upstack onto` flows, branches would be pushed to GitHub in an order that caused them to be closed prematurely.
- Added `gt branch-prefix --reset` to turn off the user prefix for automatically generated branch names.
- Cleaned up copy in `submit` commands.

## 0.18.1 2022-05-10

- `gt repo sync` and `gt repo fix` now prompt to delete closed branches in addition to merged ones.
- Added more customization for auto-generated branch name prefixes. Check out `gt user branch-date` and `gt user branch-replacement`.
- Config files are now written with 600 permissions instead of 644.
- Fixed an issue where `downstack sync` would overwrite the local copy of a branch even if the user chose not to.
- Fixed an issue where a misconfigured trunk wouldn't be brought to the user's attention.
- Fixed an issue where Graphite would fail to parse repository owner/name.
- Removed deprecation warning for `gt stacks` - it's been long enough.
- Cleaned up interactive mode copy for `submit`.

## 0.18.0 2022-05-04

**New functionality**

- Added an experimental command `gt downstack sync` to pull down the remote copy of a branch and its downstack dependencies from remote. This feature is gated behind a configuration by default, and we are still working on the documentation. If you would like to try it out and help us iterate on the feature, please join the #experimental channel in the Graphite community Slack server!
- Added additional functionality to `submit` to support the experimental collaboration features. Gated by default.
- Added additional functionality to `gt repo sync` to support the experimental collaboration features. Gated by default.

**New commands**

- Added a new command `gt branch edit` that runs a native `git rebase --interactive` over the commits on the current branch. This command is intended for advanced Git users who want to make use of the commit structure within a branch while working with Graphite.
- Added a new command `gt branch show` that runs a native `git log` over the commits on the current branch. Includes a `--patch/-p` option to view the diffs.

**New ways to use existing commands**

- Added an `--insert` option to `gt branch create` which restacks all children of the parent of the new branch onto the new branch itself.
- Added interactive branch selection for `gt upstack onto` (similar to `gt branch checkout`). No longer requires a positional argument.

- `gt repo sync` now handles `--no-interactive` correctly.
- `gt commit amend --no-edit` now fails and warns the user when there are no staged changes, just like `gt commmit create`.
- `--no-edit` is now aliased to `-n` for `gt continue` and `gt commit amend`.
- `gt continue` now supports `--all/-a` to stage all changes.
- `submit --no-interactive` no longer un-publishes submitted PRs (unless `--draft` is specified).
- `gt downstack edit` now supports an `exec/x` option to execute arbitrary shell commands in between branch restacks (based on `git rebase --interactive`).
- `gt branch delete` now supports deleting the current branch. It checks out the parent (or trunk if Graphite cannot find a parent).

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug where `submit --no-interactive` could prompt the user for reviewers.
- Fixed a bug where `gt repo owner` would set the remote as well, breaking `sync` and resulting in having to manually edit the configuration file to get Graphite working again.
- Fixed a bug where `submit` would fail for certain classes of branch name.
- Fixed a bug where comments in the `gt downstack edit` file were not respected.
- Fixed a bug where `p` as an alias for `pick` in `gt downstack edit` did not work properly.
- Fixed a bug where `fix` could swallow a rebase exception and leave the repository in a bad state.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch checkout` interactive selection would fail if executed from an untracked branch.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch delete` could fail to delete the branch but leave it in a corrupt state.

**Improvements**

- Improved the speed of `gt downstack edit` and `gt upstack onto` by being smarter about when a rebase is actually necessary.
- Improved the speed of stack validation for some commands.
- Cleaned up output of various commands and added more `--debug` logging.

**Under the hood**

- Added infra to backfill the SHA of branch parent in metadata globally wherever it is safe to do so to prepare for an upcoming update to the stack validation algorithm that we expect to improve performance and reduce hangs.
- Added plenty of tests and refactored code core to many commands for stability and future extensibility.

## 0.17.11 2022-04-23

- Fix an issue introduced in the previous version where the async calls to fill in PR info on `submit` would not be awaited serially, resulting in a poor user experience.

## 0.17.10 2022-04-22

- Fix an issue where pr data could be overwritten on `submit`.
- Decreased max branch name length slightly to support an upcoming feature.
- Start tracking SHA of branch parent in metadata, a requirement for some upcoming features.
- This version includes some initial changes to sync branch metadata with remote, gated by a hidden flag.

## 0.17.9 2022-04-14

- Flipped `gt log short` view to match other log commands and `up`/`down` naming convention. `↳` → `↱`!
- Graphite now asks for confirmation if the user tries to submit an empty branch.
- Graphite now displays an info message when it creates an empty commit on a new branch.
- The empty commit copy in the commit editor now only appears when Graphite has created an empty commit.
- Added support for remotes not named `origin` - use the new `gt repo remote` command to set the name of your remote.

- Allowlisted many git commands for passthrough.
- Added autocomplete support for `gt branch delete`.
- Changed force option on `gt branch delete` from `-D` to `-f`.
- Cleaned up output on `gt branch delete` failure.

- Added functionality to query users for feedback on the Graphite CLI.
- Refactor the suite of gt submit commands to make them more easily cancellable; re-ordered submit to edit all PRs locally before doing any writes and cancelling mid-submit will save any previously entered data (e.g. title and body).
- Submit also now includes a `--dry-run` flag to show the user what will be submitted in the invocation.
- Submit queries GitHub for PRs before submitting, resolving an issue where submit would sometimes try to create a new PR though one already existed for that head branch/base branch combo on GitHub (Graphite just didn't know about it).
